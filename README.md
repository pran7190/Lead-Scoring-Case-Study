# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study - Pranit
Problem Statement

Low Lead Conversion Rate: X Education currently experiences a typical lead conversion rate of only 30%, resulting in lost potential revenue and engagement.
Inefficient Sales Outreach: The sales team spends considerable time contacting a broad range of leads, including those with low likelihood of conversion, which can dilute their effectiveness.
Lack of Targeted Lead Identification: Without a systematic approach to identify high-potential leads (Hot Leads), the sales team cannot prioritize their efforts based on lead quality.
Need for Data-Driven Strategy: To enhance conversion rates, X Education requires a data-driven strategy to analyze lead behaviors and characteristics, enabling more effective targeting and resource allocation.


Business Objective

Objective of Lead Scoring Model: X Education aims to develop a model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 for each prospect, facilitating the identification of Hot Leads to enhance conversion rates.
Target Conversion Rate: The CEO seeks to achieve an ambitious lead conversion rate of 80%, significantly higher than the current rate, to maximize revenue and engagement.
Post-Target Strategies: Once the conversion target is achieved, the model should provide actionable insights and strategies for ongoing lead management and further improvement in conversion efforts.
